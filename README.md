# Predictive-Classifiers
A set of predictive modeling algorithms using different techniques. Binary Naive Bayes is complete, and I am current working on a decision tree
algorithm that will be uploaded once completed

Naive Bayes:
A simple NBC predictive alrogithm. Currently implemented for binary classification, but can easily be extended to support classifying variables 
with more than 2 possible outcomes. Algorithm assumes that all dat in the is discrete. Upon testing the a yelp data set,
